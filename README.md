# Real-Time-Video-Filters-with-Computer-Vision
A high-performance C++ application that applies custom-built image processing filters to live video streams using OpenCV. Implements advanced computer vision techniques including edge detection, face recognition, and depth estimation, all from scratch without relying on built-in filter functions.
